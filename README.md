# Micro-Behavioral Analysis of Online Shopping Patterns for Blind Users

## Abstract :

Online shopping has grown widely popular, providing significant convenience for people with disabilities who find travel challenging. Many prior studies look at how sighted people shop online, but not much is known about blind shoppers, who use assistive technologies such as screen readers to navigate and make purchases on online shopping platforms. Research involving blind shoppers is primarily limited to examining accessibility and usability challenges faced by them while they browse the web. To delve deeper into understanding blind user behavior through the lens of their micro-interactions on shopping platforms, we conducted a laboratory-based study with $25$ blind participants, and then analyzed their keyboard activity logs to excavate underlying micro-behavioral patterns.

Our study highlighted that blind users typically favor shopping on platforms they are familiar with and consistently utilize a specific personalized array of keyboard shortcuts when navigating these sites. We also observed that the uncertainty and randomness of information increased significantly as a user switched from a familiar to an unfamiliar webpage even if both webpages were highly accessible. Also, blind shoppers showcased a strong preference relationship with certain keyboard shortcuts, and they typically visit online platforms with a clear idea of what they intend to purchase.
